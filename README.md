# portfolio
Simple HTML, JS, CSS
Summary
A simple portfolio profile which uses HTML, JS and CSS technologies.

Solution
A profile is build using HTML various tags such as <title>, <heading>, <img>, <button> etc. I have implemented bootstrap to change the look and feel of the page. The page has a link to another page which target to another tab.


Approach
First of all, create an index.html page, this page includes all the details of the portfolio. I have added a navigation bar (<nav>) to be to link to other pages. I added an image (<img>) as a header image.

Secondly, create an image folder to store the images which are to be used in the project.

You can include a link to another page using <a> tag.  There are Birthday.html, Weather.html and linking directly to Github page.
